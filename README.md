## Overview
Course: Data Analytics & AI
Project Duration: 13.10.2025 → 18.12.2025

## **Team Members**
**Sanita Šulca** – Product & Domain Lead

## **🧭 Overview**

In many Latvian towns, there is limited access to **24/7 pharmacies**, which means people often cannot obtain essential **OTC (over-the-counter)** medicines during night hours or emergencies.  

This project develops an **AI-powered system** that:  
- **Optimizes** vending machine placement for OTC medicines  
- **Forecasts** demand and restocking needs (including expiry tracking)  
- **Provides** a safe chatbot for symptom-based consultation (*adults / kids*)  
- **Offers** a monitoring dashboard for inventory and predictive maintenance  

The goal is to improve **healthcare accessibility**, **reduce medicine waste**, and **ensure compliance** with Latvian regulations for OTC medicine sales.

## **💡 Key Features**

- 🗺️ **Placement Optimization:** Uses *Maximal Covering Location Problem* (MCLP) algorithms to determine where vending machines should be installed for maximum population coverage.  
- 📈 **Demand & Stock Forecasting:** Predicts usage and refill needs using time-series and regression models (ARIMA, XGBoost).  
- ⏱️ **Expiry & Stock Control:** Tracks expiry dates, automates FEFO (First-Expire, First-Out) logic, and enforces one-package-per-group purchase limits.  
- 🤖 **Chatbot Assistance:** A bilingual (Latvian/English) chatbot providing safe, non-diagnostic OTC guidance based on symptoms and age group (adults/kids).  
- 📊 **Monitoring Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of machine status, stock levels, expiry alerts, and predictive maintenance notifications.  
- ⚙️ **Data-Driven Management:** Implements the **Data-Driven Scrum (DDS)** framework to enable measurable progress and continuous improvement.
